                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>It is fun to think, design, and create games as it can be enjoyed by all ages. For me, games are another form of storytelling that keeps the players engaged and allows them to interpret it in different meanings. As for development and designing, I am capable of using multiple softwares such as Unity, Blender, Android Studio and several Adobe softwares (After effects, premiere pro, photoshop).</p>

                <p>Kitsune Rush is a fast paced 2D side scrolling roguelike platformer couch co-op game where the players work together to invade a mega-corporation’s headquarters. It can be played by up to four players. Players need to work alongside each other to defeat the enemies in order to reach the final boss in every stage.</p>

                <p>This project was created using Unity in C++ language. One of my team members and I decided to do pair programming during the backend process so that it is easier to bounce ideas off each other. Furthermore, it is to hasten the quality check and debugging process of the project. I was mainly responsible for the shop’s mechanic of the game.</p>
